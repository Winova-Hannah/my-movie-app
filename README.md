# Movie Ticket Booking System

Hey there!

I built this simple movie ticket booking system where you can:
- Pick your movie and showtime.
- Choose your seats.
- Pay for the tickets and confirm your booking.

## What’s inside?
- **Choose your Date & Time**: You can pick the date and time for the movie you want to watch.
- **Pick Your Seats**: See an interactive seat layout, and select where you want to sit.
- **No Unavailable Seats**: Any seat that’s already taken will be grayed out, so you can’t book it.
- **Proceed to Payment**: Once you’re done, just hit the button to confirm your booking and head to payment.

## The Tech Stuff
- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, CSS
- **Routing**: React Router for page navigation
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState and useNavigate)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS because who doesn’t love good design?

## How to Run It

### Prerequisites
Make sure you’ve got **Node.js** and **npm** installed. If not, grab them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Setup
1. **Clone the repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-ticket-booking-system.git
   cd movie-ticket-booking-system
````

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   It’ll open the app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### 1. **Date & Time Selection**:

Pick a movie time that works for you! No more endless scrolling to see when the movie starts.

### 2. **Seat Selection**:

I’ve built a seat selection grid where you can choose your perfect seat. Just click on the available ones!

### 3. **Payment**:

After selecting your seats, you can hit the “Proceed to Payment” button, and boom – booking confirmed!

### 4. **Responsive Design**:

No matter what device you’re on, the app will look great. Whether you’re on mobile or desktop, I’ve got you covered.

## Ideas for Cool Future Features

Now, this is where things get fun! I’ve got some ideas for cool stuff you can add if you’re interested in improving or expanding this system:

### 1. **Snacks and Takeout**

* You know how we always want snacks during a movie? Well, what if you could add popcorn, nachos, or even drinks to your ticket while booking? Even better, what if you could choose “takeout” snacks to pick up before the show?

### 2. **Surprise Movie for Friends**

* Imagine surprising a friend with a movie ticket! Select a movie, and the app will pick a random showtime, book the tickets, and make it a surprise. Maybe even add a random movie generator!

### 3. **Movie Gift Cards**

* You could buy digital movie gift cards for your friends or family! Send them a movie night gift, and they can redeem it later. You can customize the gift card value, too!

### 4. **Customize Your Own Theater**

* Ever wanted to make your own movie theater experience? Choose the seat layout, select premium seats like recliners, pick theater styles (IMAX, VIP, 3D), and maybe even adjust room acoustics.

### 5. **Advanced Seat Booking**

* If you’re booking something special, let users reserve premium seats, like VIP seats or front row spots.

### 6. **User Profiles & Recommendations**

* How about having a user profile where you can see your booking history, upcoming movies, and even get recommendations based on what you’ve watched before?

### 7. **Real-Time Seat Availability**

* Add a feature where seat availability updates in real-time, so you never run into the issue of booking a seat that’s already taken.

### 8. **Multi-Language Support**

* The app could be made available in different languages to cater to more users. Maybe your friends in another country would like to use it too!

### 9. **Mobile App Version**

* You could build this out as a mobile app, and imagine having push notifications reminding you of your movie tickets or upcoming movie releases?
